        Mershon Enterprises does business the <strong>Bakersfield</strong> way.
        While we're happy to offer maintenance and support services for software
        written by us or your previous developer, we don't believe in
        indefinitely entangling our business with yours.

        <p>Our offerings are best suited to established businesses with at least
          5 years of operational history who are building new products or
          expanding into new verticals.
        </p>
        <p>For product development projects, you own a full, unabridged copy
          of all source code, object code, technical documentation, user
          documentation, and supporting code developed for your project which
          cannot be revoked even if you decide to quit using our services
          mid-project and work with another agency. Unlike many developers,
          freelance and agency alike, we do not use a "Software as a Service"
          pricing model for the products we build, which would require you to
          pay a monthly fee indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>We offer a straightforward pricing model: all proposals and invoices
          are based on hours worked, and we limit your risk by capping each
          phase of a project as <strong>Time &amp; Materials, Not to
          Exceed</strong>. This means the price on the paper is the biggest
          number you will ever see, for the full scope and duration of the
          project, and if we take less time to get your project finished, you
          reap the savings.
