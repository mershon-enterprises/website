        <p>Mershon Enterprises does business the Bakersfield way. While we're
          happy to offer maintenance and support services for software written by
          us or your previous developer, we don't believe in indefinitely
          entangling our business with yours.</p>
        <p>For any development project, you own a full, unabridged copy of all
          source code, object code, technical documentation, user documentation,
          and supporting code developed for your project which cannot be revoked
          even if you decide to quit using our services mid-project and work
          with another agency. Unlike many developers, freelance and agency
          alike, we do not use a "Software as a Service" pricing model for the
          products we build, which would require you to pay a monthly fee
          indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Instead, we offer a straightforward pricing
          model: all proposals and invoices are based on hours worked, and
          we limit your risk by capping each phase of a project as
          <strong>Time &amp; Materials, Not to Exceed</strong>. This means
          the price on the paper is the biggest number you will ever see,
          for the full scope and duration of the project, and if we take
          less time to get your project finished, you reap the savings.</p>

        <p>Occasionally, customers need the support and quality of service we
          provide, but cannot afford the services of our local developer talent.
          When this occurs, we are happy to facilitate an outsourcing
          relationship with one of our preferred offshore vendors for a modest
          project management fee.</p>
