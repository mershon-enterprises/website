        <p>Mershon Enterprises was founded February 2015, but has roots that
        tie back to summer of 2003. Kevin Mershon, a Bakersfield native, started
        his career as a software developmer at Krummrich Engineering in the
        Metro Centre off Truxton Ave. at the age of 18. Over the course of the
        next ten years, Kevin learned the ins and outs of the petroleum,
        shipping, finance, and automation industries, trained over a dozen
        developers as apprentices, and designed and maintained at least as many
        software systems.</p>

        <p>Today, Mershon Enterprises is transitioning into a
        <strong>"Platform as a Service"</strong> company, though we still
        provide a a lot of ongoing support and generalized custom software
        development to clients local and afar.</p>
