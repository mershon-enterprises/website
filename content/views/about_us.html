        <p>The roots of Mershon Enterprises date back to summer 2003, though the
        company in its current incarnation was founded April 2015. Kevin
        Mershon, a Bakersfield native, started his career as a freelance software
        developmer at Krummrich Engineering, a Bakersfield oilfield engineering
        company. Over the course of the next ten years, Kevin learned the
        ins and outs of the petroleum and shipping industries, trained over a
        dozen developers as apprentices, and designed and maintained at least as
        many software systems.</p>
