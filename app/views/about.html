        <p>Beth Started out college with plans of pursuing a degree related to
          math or science. After she finally settled on math, she stumbled
          across computer programming as a required course for a math major.
          About half way through the semester, she found that she was expanding
          on the material and modifying old assignments in her free time, which
          was when she realized that she had fallen in love with programming.
          Since then she's made phenomenal progress developing programming
          skills by a combination of what she can teach herself, what she can
          learn from senior developers, and by pursuing a bachelors degree in
          computer science.</p>

          <li>"Greenfield" Development: $105 / hour, billed twice per month</li>
          <li>Support &amp; Maintenance: $205 / hour, billed twice per month</li>
          <li>15% discount on first two invoices, for new clients only</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="6u">
        <p>At Mershon Enterprises, we don't believe in entangling our
          business with yours. That said, we do offer support and
          maintenance services for our own software, and that of other
          developers as well.</p>
        <p>For any development project, you own a full, unabridged copy of all
          source code, object code, technical documentation, user documentation,
          and supporting code developed for your project which cannot be revoked
          even if you decide to quit using our services mid-project and work
          with another agency. Unlike many developers, freelance and agency
          alike, we do not use a "Software as a Service" pricing model for the
          products we build, which would require you to pay a monthly fee
          indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Instead, we offer a straightforward pricing
          model: all proposals and invoices are based on hours worked, and
          we limit your risk by capping each phase of a project as
          <strong>Time &amp; Materials, Not to Exceed</strong>. This means
          the price on the paper is the biggest number you will ever see,
          for the full scope and duration of the project, and if we take
          less time to get your project finished, you reap the savings.</p>

        <p>Mershon Enterprises employs a number of Project Controls

        budget, and within scope. These methods include Agile, Scrum, and
        the more conventional critical path method. Our project schedules
        are all loaded with cost and labor hours for the purposes of earned
        value reporting and analysis. With this data, we report on budget
        and schedule issues as they arise, and find strategic solutions
        before projects are at risk. We also offer project administration
        services a la carte, including conversion between formats.

        <p>
          Your business needs aren't constrained to your desk or your office,
          and your software solutions shouldn't be either.
          Being a virtual company means our developers build lightweight,
          efficient software out of necessity. Portable software is better for
          your business because it allows you to ask questions and get answers
          on-the-go, even with intermittent connectivity.
