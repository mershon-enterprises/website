        <p>At Mershon Enterprises, we don't believe in entangling our
          business with yours. You own a full, unabridged copy of all source
          code, object code, technical documentation, user documentation,
          and supporting code developed for your project, that cannot be
          revoked even if you decide to quit using our services mid-project
          and work with another agency. Unlike many developers, freelance
          and agency alike, we do not use a "Software as a Service" pricing
          model for the products we build, which would require you to pay a
          monthly fee indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Instead, we offer a straightforward pricing
          model: all proposals and invoices are based on hours worked, and
          we limit your risk by capping each phase of a project as
          <strong>Time &amp; Materials, Not to Exceed</strong>. This means
          the price on the paper is the biggest number you will ever see,
          for the full scope and duration of the project, and if we take
          less time to get your project finished, you reap the savings.</p>

        <h2 class="major"><span>Project Administrative Controls</span></h2>

        <p>Mershon Enterprises employs a number of Project Controls
        methodologies to ensure that each project is delivered on time, on
        budget, and within scope. These methods include Agile, Scrum, and
        the more conventional critical path method. Our project schedules
        are all loaded with cost and labor hours for the purposes of earned
        value reporting and analysis. With this data, we report on budget
        and schedule issues as they arise, and find strategic solutions
        before projects are at risk. We also offer project administration
        services a la carte, including conversion between formats.

      <h2 class="major"><span>Benefits of a Virtual Company</span></h2>

      <p>
        Your business needs aren't constrained to your desk or your office,
        and your software solutions shouldn't be either.
        Being a virtual company means our developers build lightweight,
        efficient software out of necessity. Portable software is better for
        your business because it allows you to ask questions and get answers
        on-the-go, even with intermittent connectivity.

      <p>Being a virtual company doesn't mean our programmers work in

        <a href="https://meshcowork.cobot.me/" target="_blank">Mesh
          Cowork</a>, Bakersfield's first coworking facility. Together with
        other entrepreneurs, freelance software developers, and inspired
