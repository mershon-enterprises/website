        <p>The roots of Mershon Enterprises date back to summer 2003, though the
        company in its current incarnation was founded April 2015. Kevin
        Mershon, a Bakersfield native, started his career as a freelance software
        developmer at Krummrich Engineering, a Bakersfield oilfield engineering
        company. Over the course of the next ten years, Kevin learned the
        ins and outs of the petroleum and shipping industries, trained over a
        dozen developers as apprentices, and designed and maintained at least as
        many software systems.</p>

        <h3>Software Developer</h3>
        <p>Beth Started out college with plans of pursuing a degree related to
          math or science. After she finally settled on math, she stumbled
          across computer programming as a required course for a math major.
          About half way through the semester, she found that she was expanding
          on the material and modifying old assignments in her free time, which
          was when she realized that she had fallen in love with programming.
          Since then she's made phenomenal progress developing programming
          skills by a combination of what she can teach herself, what she can
          learn from senior developers, and by pursuing a bachelors degree in
          computer science.</p>
